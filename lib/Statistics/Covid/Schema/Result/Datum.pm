=head1 NAME

Statistics::Covid::Schema::Result::Datum - Datum is a table in our database of collected Covid statistics and this module initialises this table using DBIx::Class


=head1 VERSION

Version 0.24



Whenever a new table is to be created, call it ABC, then you
must copy this file


=head1 DESCRIPTION
This module is not to be used directly. It creates the table Datum
with information, such as tablename, table schema,
primary key columns, etc., stored in L<Statistics::Covid::Datum::Table>.
The procedure to create a new table, call it ABC, is as follows:

=over 2

=item Create Statistics::Covid::ABC::Table to contain the schema of
the new table, by copying L<Statistics::Covid::Datum::Table>
and modifying it.

=item Create Statistics::Covid::Schema::Result::ABC modelled on
this current module. The basic action performed by this module
is to create a table, its columns using the specific table schema
which you will see its format in L<Statistics::Covid::Datum::Table>,
and the column name(s) to form the primary key.

=item Insert this

    use Statistics::Covid::Schema;

in every module you want to access this and every other table you already created.
Then follow L<DBIx::Class> guidelines on how to deploy the database and
interact with these tables. Something along these lines:

    my $dsn = 'dbi:SQLite:dbname=MyDB.sqlite';
    my $shemahandle = Statistics::Covid::Schema->connect($dsn, "", "", $dbparams);
    # create the table, will die if table exists
    $shemahandle->deploy();
    # find rows for the given table and where condition ...
    my $resultset = $shemahandle->('Datum')->search({name=>'Samarkand'});
    # ... and act on them
    $resultset->delete();
    $shemahandle->disconnect();
