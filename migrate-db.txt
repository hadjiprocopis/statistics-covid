# how to migrate from older database format:
# the BBC, GOVUK and JHU sites provide only daily data, so we need
# to load that data from json files on disk:
bin/db-load-data-from-fetched-data-files-v0.23-to-v0.24.bash 'UK::BBC' && \
bin/db-load-data-from-fetched-data-files-v0.23-to-v0.24.bash 'UK::GOVUK' && \
bin/db-load-data-from-fetched-data-files-v0.23-to-v0.24.bash 'World::JHU' && \
bin/db-load-data-from-fetched-data-files-v0.23-to-v0.24.bash 'World::JHUgithub' && \
bin/db-load-data-from-fetched-data-files-v0.23-to-v0.24.bash 'CY::UCY'

# note: for CY::UCY there will be errors for older data files
# so move these to somewhere can not be found by recursive find_files()B

# for the localdir ones, tell them to load again (because we dont save
# local files because already are there localfiles!)
perl -I blib/lib script/statistics-covid-fetch-data-and-store.pl \
 --config-file config/v0.24.1-config.json \
 --provider 'World::JHUlocaldir' \
 --provider-dir "./COVID-19"

>>>> WARNING <<<<<
Finally, copy the new database file
to the old one and that's it!
DO NOT DELETE the old dir or copy the new dir onto
the old dir overwriting it. DONT DO THAT unless
you want to loose all the old fetched data files too!
SO, keep the old dir as it is except for the database which you should
overwrite with the newly created.
